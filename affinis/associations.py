    - If "forest-max", use Expected Forest Maximization, an E-M scheme
      to estimate the posterior probability of both the edge
      activations _and_ the underlying graph structure, via
      alternating minimization.
      See [expected_forest_maximization][affinis.associations.expected_forest_maximization].
    - If "interaction", re-weight the "edge-prob" values to be the
      likelihood of observing an edge activation, _given_ the
      observed data (useful e.g. for bayesian inference).
